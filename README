ROSEdu Voting Script version 0.1

Each user votes in a file called vote.txt in their home.  The script does
some checks to ensure there are no invalid, double, or too few/many votes.
If everything is all right, it gathers individual votes and counts them

Config files:
* userlist.txt - list of local users who can vote;
* candidates.txt - list of candidate IDs;
  A candidate ID is not necessarily a valid username.
* num_votes.txt - contains a single number, which
  is the number of votes each user can cast.

Results are placed in results.txt, with individual votes in the votes/
directory.  There is no way that I know of to find out who voted for who.

TODOs:
* if vote files contain blank lines, they are counted as individual votes.
We should filter out blank or whitespace-only lines.

Patches are welcome, of course, use github or email.
